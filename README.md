# WIP
This library is still a work in progress, oops!

# OIJSON
OIJSON is just another implementation of a c json parser.

# Build
Compile and link oijson.c, include oijson.h to use the library. The CMake build builds a simple test program.

# Usage
Use oijson_parse to identify the json type of objects, arrays or values, then use the desired object, array or value functions.
